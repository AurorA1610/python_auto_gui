# python_auto_gui

Imagine a situation where you need to say "I love you" or "Sorry" to someone very special over any chatting app for 1000 times. Will you actually toil away writing the message and sending 1000 times?  
  
That would be ponderous.  
  
Don't worry, this Python program is here for automating tasks like that.  
  
### Run this code on your IDE. But make sure that _your cursor is on the message input field of the intendent recipient_. Otherwise, the message will be sent elsewhere.
